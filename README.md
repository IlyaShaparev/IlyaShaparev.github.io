### :robot: More about the project

This project is not finished and soon I plan to add a Backend part for it in the form of databases. The site is deployed on Github Pages. And you can read it at the link.

:exclamation: It is enough to specify one character in the authorization fields (:warning: Attention: Do not leave these fields empty when clicking the "Continue" button).

:iphone: Another equally interesting feature of this project is the presence of adaptive layout. The resource was written using Mobile First technology, which made it possible to create the most convenient mobile interface.

So, for example, the navigation menu turns into a burger menu at a low screen resolution, and tables acquire scrolling.
